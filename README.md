**`Computer Science - Minoring in Cyber Security`**

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- The *Django* web framework (along with sharpening my *Python* and *SQLite* skills). This is a recreation of my portfolio website, utilizing most of the HTML and CSS from my old AWS website implementation. I'm not a huge fan of Django so far as it seems to have limited customizability... but I'm sure that's just my lack of skill.

- How to play competitive soccer. 
- The fingerstyle guitar cover for Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion & Clair de Lune by Debussy.
