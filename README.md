**`Computer Science - Minoring in Cyber Security`**

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- The **Django** web framework (along with sharpening my **Python** and **SQLite** skills). I'm recreating my portfolio, utilizing most of the HTML and CSS from my old AWS website implementation. I'm not a huge fan as it seems to have limited customizability... but that is probably just my lack of skill. Visit the repository @ [joet-dev/django-website](https://github.com/joet-dev/django-website)
- How to play competitive soccer. 
- The fingerstyle for Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion on guitar. 

:heavy_check_mark: Recently Completed Projects: 
- OurBook - Billing Ledger **C#** and **SQL**. Visit the repository @ [joet-dev/OurBook](https://github.com/joet-dev/OurBook)

:bulb: Future Projects:
