**`Computer Science - Minoring in Cyber Security`**

### 🌱 I’m currently learning: 
- The *Django* web framework (along with sharpening my *Python* and *SQLite* skills). This is a recreation of my portfolio website, utilizing most of the HTML and CSS from my old AWS website implementation. I'm not a huge fan of Django so far as it seems to have limited customizability... but I'm sure that's just my lack of skill. Visit the repository @ [joet-dev/django-website](https://github.com/joet-dev/django-website)
- How to play competitive soccer. 
- The fingerstyle guitar cover for Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion & Clair de Lune by Debussy. 

### ✔️ Recently Completed Projects: 
- OurBook - Billing Ledger for tenants written in *C#* and *SQL*. Visit the repository @ [joet-dev/OurBook](https://github.com/joet-dev/OurBook)

### :bulb: Future Projects: 
- Girlfriend
- I would like to explore more Python data analytics, automation, or machine learning projects.
