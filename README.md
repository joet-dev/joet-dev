**`Computer Science - Minoring in Cyber Security`**

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- The *Django* web framework (along with sharpening my *Python* and *SQLite* skills). This is a recreation of my portfolio, utilizing most of the HTML and CSS from my old AWS website implementation. I'm not a huge fan as it seems to have limited customizability... but that is probably just my lack of skill. Visit the repository @ [joet-dev/django-website](https://github.com/joet-dev/django-website)
- How to play competitive soccer. 
- The fingerstyle guitar cover for Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion & Clair de Lune by Debussy.
